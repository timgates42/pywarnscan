# pywarnscan
Scan python dependencies looking for active warnings either on load or during tests

# Disclaimer
Currently this is just a project for me to try out GitHub App integrations like
code coverage and Azure pipelines. I hope it can be useful in the future for
helping to find warnings raised in other python projects.
